# AndroidWorkshop

## Pre-Configuration

1. `git clone https://github.com/MoreNaruto/AndroidWorkshop.git`
2. Download Android Studio (if you don't already have it)
3. Android Studio will have a prompt that will ask you to open the project
    1. Go to the directory where you clones the repository.
    2. Open the build.gradle file, so the project will build with gradle.
    3. If Android Studio prompt you for any updates for gradle, allow them to update 
    the gradle version.
4. Since we're using lombok, please install the lombok plugin for Android Studio
(if you haven't already)
5. Click on Android Studio > Preferences > Annotation Processors and enable the Annotation 
Processor
6. Run the app on your phone, and it should be a blank screen with the title
'Android Workshop'
